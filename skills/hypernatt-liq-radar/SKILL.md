# HyperNatt Liq Radar - trading-agent skill

**What this skill is:** text instructions so an OpenClaw/Hermes agent knows
**when and how** to call a **remote** MCP market-data tool.

**What this skill is NOT:** a local trading bot, shell scripts, custody, or
order execution. It does **not** instruct the agent to move funds.

## Declared capabilities (honest)

| Capability | Declared |
|------------|----------|
| Local exec / shell | **No** |
| Local filesystem | **No** |
| Env vars required | **None** |
| Outbound network | `https://hypernatt.com` (MCP + docs) ; optional Coinbase payments docs |
| Tools | Remote MCP only - agent runtime must already support MCP connectors |
| Fund movement / swap | **Out of scope for this skill** (see related `hypernatt-terminal`) |

## Remote MCP (single host)

| Resource | URL |
|----------|-----|
| MCP | https://hypernatt.com/mcp/protocol |
| Server card | https://hypernatt.com/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json |
| Source | https://github.com/DIALLOUBERESEARCH/hypernatt-terminal |
| Security | https://github.com/DIALLOUBERESEARCH/hypernatt-terminal/blob/main/SECURITY.md |
| Full 6-tool onboarding | related skill `hypernatt-terminal` |

## Tools this skill uses (market-data only)

1. **get_agent_manifest** - Free - Catalog
2. **get_liq_radar** - $0.001 USDC x402 - Forced-order / liquidation map

Whitelist symbols for get_liq_radar: BTC ETH SOL BNB XRP HYPE ZEC (omit = BTC).

The same MCP host also exposes `swap_via_nattswap`. That path can move funds
(agent signs on-chain). **Do not use swap under this skill** - use related
skill `hypernatt-terminal` if bridging/funding is required.

Daily MCP trial: one free call per paid tool and per token per client each UTC day. Four tools x seven tokens = up to 28 independent trials; then 0.001 USDC per call. Read trial_policy_v2 and free_tier_status_v1 on the same MCP connection for current availability. A zero daily_cap is the separate credit pool, not the intro allowance.

## When to use

Before sizing or entering a **perp**, if the user asks to trade better / check
liquidations / market microstructure (any venue).

## Example (MCP tool call - not local shell)

```
# Free catalog (via MCP runtime)
tools/call get_agent_manifest {}

# Paid market-data (via MCP runtime + x402 wallet)
tools/call get_liq_radar {"symbol":"ETH"}
```

## Loop

1. Ensure MCP connector URL above is configured in the agent runtime.
2. `get_agent_manifest` (free) once per session if needed.
3. `get_liq_radar` with optional `symbol`.
4. If `cluster_grammar` is present, read it **before** `liq_radar`. Ignore `class=noise` (<3%). `class=true` (~7%+) is terrain, not an entry. Do not treat `largest_*` near mark as the hunt.
5. Execute trades via a **separate** venue skill (CEX / DEX / perps). This skill
   does not place orders and does not instruct swaps.

## Payment (x402)

Use an available daily MCP trial or eligible credit first. When payment is required, MCP can return HTTP 200 with `isError: true` and payment requirements in the tool's JSON text content. Select an offered rail from `accepts[]` and retry the same call with `x_payment`: **0.001 USDC exact** on **Base (EIP-3009)** or **Solana (SVM exact)**. Solana requires `@x402/svm` (feePayer = `extra.feePayer`, `accepted.asset` = mint); an EVM/Base signer cannot pay it. The host's authorized payment client pays for the data call only. This skill holds no keys. See [payment and shared credits](../../docs/x402-pay.md).

## Honest claims

- Not trade advice - no custody - no performance promise
- Vault P&L on hypernatt.com is **not** this MCP's track record
- This skill = market-data path only (manifest + liq radar)
