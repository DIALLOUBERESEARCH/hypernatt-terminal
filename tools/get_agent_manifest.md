# `get_agent_manifest`

**Start here.** Free compact catalog (tools, prices, cluster `do_not`, honest usage). Pass `detail=full` for quota/pass/onboarding.

## Price

**Free**

## Live MCP surface (4 tools)

| Tool | Role | Price |
|------|------|-------|
| `get_agent_manifest` | Catalog, value prop, scenarios, glossary | Free |
| `get_liq_radar` | Forced-order / liquidation map (BTC ETH SOL BNB XRP HYPE ZEC) | 1 credit / $0.001 x402 |
| `swap_via_nattswap` | Li.Fi quote + execution playbook | Free at MCP layer |
| `get_native_depth` | Recorded liquidity, wall history and aggressor flow for a BTC or ETH size | 1 credit / $0.001 x402 |

Choose `journeys_v1` by intent: radar for liquidation terrain; native depth for filmed BTC/ETH size feasibility; swap for a Li.Fi route. Compact and full include the same actionable journey.

## Inputs

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `locale` | string | No | Not a translation switch. Ignored. English only. |
| `detail` | string | No | Default `compact`. `full` = quota/pass/onboarding. |

## Outputs

The default **compact** response contains `terminal`, `description`, the four-entry `tools[]`, `journeys_v1`, `trial_policy_v2` and `pricing`. Radar-specific guidance is in `value_proposition_v1`, `use_scenarios_v1` and `glossary_v1`.

With **`detail=full`**, read `sections[]`, `onboarding`, `pass_program`, `quota_program` and radar guidance in `agent_interpretation_rules_v1`. Both forms include `journeys_v1`. Client-specific `free_tier_status_v1` requires the same MCP client identity; anonymous REST discovery is not that client's remaining allowance. Usage counters are optional.
